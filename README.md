# Linux-Scripting
A bunch of self made scripts to automate tasks on linux based operating systems. In addition some documentation is also available for how to use them.

# Some basic utilities
There are some basic command line utilities that are used constantly, and it would be impossible to proceed further without using some of them in simple form before we discuss them in more detail. A short list has to include:
- cat: used to type out a file (or combine files).
- head: used to show the first few lines of a file.
- tail: used to show the last few lines of a file.
- man: used to view documentation.

# Navigate on the terminal
To navigate to a directory from the terminal simply use cd followed by the directory for example:
> cd /home
Another option is to open the directory with the file manager, right click and select open in terminal.
