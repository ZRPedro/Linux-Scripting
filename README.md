# Linux-Scripting
A bunch of self made scripts to automate tasks on linux based operating systems. In addition some documentation is also available for how to use them.

# Some basic utilities
There are some basic command line utilities that are used constantly, and it would be impossible to proceed further without using some of them in simple form before we discuss them in more detail. A short list has to include:
- cat: used to type out a file (or combine files).
- head: used to show the first few lines of a file.
- tail: used to show the last few lines of a file.
- man: used to view documentation.

# Absolute and Relative paths
An absolute pathname begins with the root directory (/) and follows the tree, branch by branch, until it reaches the desired directory or file. Absolute paths always start with /.

A relative pathname starts from the present working directory. Relative paths never start with /.

Most of the time, it is most convenient to use relative paths, which require less typing. Usually, you take advantage of the shortcuts provided by: . (present directory), .. (parent directory) and ~ (your home directory).
